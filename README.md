# ðŸŒ¿ Plantopia â€“ Plant Nursery Website

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

Plantopia is a front-end web project designed to represent a modern, responsive plant nursery website. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it showcases a clean homepage layout with interactive elements and a modal-based login and registration system.

The website features a fixed navigation bar with menu items, a search input field, and Font Awesome icons for a polished user interface. A "Login" button triggers a popup modal where users can log in or register. The forms include icons, smooth transitions, and intuitive layout to enhance user experience.

This static website project demonstrates core front-end development skills and design principles. It's a great foundation for future enhancements such as dynamic product listings, user authentication, or backend integration.
